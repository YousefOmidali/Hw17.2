<p> Now that you're an<strong> HTML5 ninja</strong>, it's time for you to show us what can do. Have a look at the html files we
    created throughout the course as reference. Now go and try making your own website with just HTML5! Once you
    are done, share your website
    with the slack community and fellow students of this course! I will alsi be checking the #html channel with
    any new submissions. You can send your files as a message or wait until later in in the course where I show
    you how to put it online for free.</p>
<p><strong> I will be picking my favourite ones and showcasing them in a future video in the course. </strong></p>
<p>Good luck! </p>
